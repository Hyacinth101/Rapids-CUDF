cuDF is a Python library that works like pandas, but runs on the GPU instead of the CPU. It’s great for handling large datasets quickly. With cuDF, you can load, filter, join, and manipulate data much faster — especially when using large CSVs or running complex operations. It’s part of the RAPIDS AI ecosystem developed by NVIDIA.

Here, I have included:
